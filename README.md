# git protocol

When working on a feature, create a new branch with your name and the feature name. 

`git checkout -b <name>/<feature>`

This call will create a new branch and switch to that branch at time of creation

Then when you are done with this feature or want to integrate into master, add and commit your changes:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "some commit message"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```


<!-- Then checkout the master branch and merge your feature into master

'git checkout master'

'git merge name-feature'
 -->
